*pairs.txt*	Automatically complete pairs and surround text.

				 by simitian

This plugin causes pairs like "()" to automatically be closed when typing the
first character. It also provides a surround operator and additional keymaps
to change and delete surrounding pairs.

==============================================================================
Autopairs						*pairs-autopair*

Autopairs are defined by filetype and should automatically apply when typing
in a buffer. When you type the closing character of a pair, if a pair was
previously automatically closed in this insert, then the closing pair will
"type over" the automatically closed pair. If you type an opening pair and it
isn't preceded by a "bad lead" character, then the pair will be automatically
closed. For pairs where the opening and closing characters are identical, the
closing pair will be tested first, then the opening pair.

Pressing <cr> while in between two pair characters will separate them
normally, then add an additional line between the two which should be
correctly indented. This is equivalent to pressing the keys <cr><up><end><cr>.
Pressing <bs> while in between two pair characters will delete both the
opening and closing character as if you typed <bs><del>.

To insert a character without causing pairing, use CTRL-V, then the character
you want to pair. This will prevent the insert mappings from taking effect,
and will insert the character that you type literally. This is extremely
useful default vim behavior that not enough people know about; it can even
input control characters or literal tabs even when 'expandtab' is on.

==============================================================================
Surroundings						*pairs-surround*

Surrounds allow easy manipulation of pairs around text. The surround operator
allows you to add a variety of different forms of text on each side of a
selection. The delete and change operators allow manipulation of existing
surroundings in a line. All of the keymaps below work with |single-repeat|
using the |.| keymap; they WILL NOT prompt the user for a new pair identifier
to surround/replace.

SURROUND OPERATOR					*pairs-surround-add*
						*pairs-s* *pairs-ss* *pairs-S*
						*pairs-v_s* *pairs-v_S*

The remapped s operator (surround) allows you to surround any text with
predefined pairs. After activating the operator with s, ss, or S---which all
target text the same way as built-in operators like |d|, |dd|, and |D|, even
in the various visual modes---the operator will prompt you for a single key
which will deciede what the selection is surrounded with. Either character
from the pair is accepted.

DELETE SURROUNDINGS			*pairs-delete-surroundings* *pairs-ds*

Surroundings on either side of the cursor can be deleted with the ds keymap.
This will prompt the user for a type of pair like when adding surroundings,
then it will delete the surroundings that you specified at the prompt.

To find surrounding pairs, this plugin uses |text-objects| internally. If the
behavior is strange, try using `va` followed by the opening character of the
pair to ensure that you understand how the text object works. This plugin will
automatically ignore white space at the edges of the text object region, but
it will not do any more complicated operations on the resulting selection.

CHANGE SURROUNDINGS			*pairs-change-surroundings* *pairs-cs*

Surroundings can be changed with the cs keymap. This works like a combination
of the delete and add occurring back to back. The keymap will prompt for a
pair to delete, then instead of deleting that pair it will prompt again for a
pair to replace it with. Like with deletion, this keymap uses text objects to
identify the pairs that need to be changed.
