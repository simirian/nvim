*calendir.txt*	Calendar and journalling functionality.

				 by simirian

This plugin makes it easy for you to keep a journal and open calendar buffers
to help keep track of that journal.

==============================================================================
Calendir Directory					  *calendir-directory*

All of your journal entries are stored in the directory specified by
`g:calendir`. By default the calendir will be `~/Documents/calendir`. The
layout of files in this directory is very simple: journal entries are sorted
into directories by year, and each year is sorted by month. This means that to
access the entry for a partifular date, you must simply edit the file
`CALENDIR/year/month/day.md`, though note that the month and day will always
be two characters. All entries are created as markdown files.

==============================================================================
Calendir Command				*calendir-command* *:Calendir*

All of the functionality of this plugin is available through the `:Calendir`
command. It has several subcommands which can be used to interact with
features of the plugin. Adding a `!` to the end of the command works like
normal editing commands and will hide the current buffer before opening the
calendar or journal file.

CALENDIR JOURNAL			   *calendir-journal* *calendir-today*
				      *calendir-yesterday* *calendir-tomorrow*

The calendir plugin's primary goal is to make it simple to keep a daily
journal. The journal stored in the |calendir-directory| can be accessed and
updated from anywhere. The command `:Calendir today` will open the note for
the current day, as defined by your operating system. The commands
`:Calendir yesterday` and `:Calendir tomorrow` can be used to edit the journal
entries of their respective days. If a journal entry does not yet exist, then
a new buffer is created at its location and it will be given the header "#
Daily year-month-day".

CALENDIR DATES				   *calendir-calendar* *calendir-date*

The default argument to the `:Calendir` command is a date. The date can
specify a year, month, and day each as a list of digits separated by slashes
with no spaces. Supplying a full year, month, and day will open the journal
entry for that date or create it if it does not exist. Omitting the day from
the date will only target a month, and will open a monthly calendar in the
current window. Omitting the day and month will open a yearly calendar
instead. Calendars will have special highlight for the current day,
unimportant days, and days which have a journal entry file.

CALENDIR NAVIGATION			   *calendir-previous* *calendir-next*

While in any calendir buffer, you can navigate to nearby calendir buffers with
the `:Calendir next` and `:Calendir previous` commands. When in a journal
entry, this will navigate to the previous or next journal entry. While in a
month calendar, this will navigate to adjacent months, and while in a year
calendar to adjacent years.
