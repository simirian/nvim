*scratch.txt*	Scratch buffer editing.

				 by simirian

This plugin adds a quick interface for editing multiple scratch buffers of
various file types, as well as a dummy text buffer.

==============================================================================
Commands						*scratch-commands*

The interface for this plugin is exposed through two commands. Both of these
commands create scratch buffers which adhere to |scratch-buffer|, but will
also be listed in the buffer list.

SCRATCH						*:Scratch* *scratch-command*

The `:Scratch` command opens an empty scratch buffer. The argument supplied to
the command will be interpreted as a file type, and the 'filetype' option will
be set to the argument for that scratch buffer. Using a count will edit that
particular scratch buffer for that file type. This means that each file type
(including no file type) have an independent set of buffers of that file type.

ANNABELL LEE				*:AnnabellLee* *annabell-lee-command*

The `:AnnabelLee` command can be used to open a buffer with dummy text. There
is exactly one annabel lee buffer, unlike with the `:Scratch` command. The
file type of the buffer will be markdown and the text in the buffer is the
poem "Annabell Lee" by Edgar Allen Poe.
